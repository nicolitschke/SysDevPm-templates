# Templates for Project, Safety and System Development Management
You find here ready-to-use documents and templates for development projects. This repository has 3 main goals:
1. **Speed**: If I start to colloborate with a new customer, a lot of valuable time is wasted to identify the required documents. You can save time and start to work with proven templates.
2. **Copy the proven stuff**: In Automotive many project teams and suppliers from all over the world work together. Yet, a gazillion amount of money is spend to copy-paste the requirements from standards to Word/Excel/Wikis.
3. **Let's share**: If a template really fixes your problem. Yay! Please share your thoughts. What worked well? Where do you see improvements?
In case you find any issues with these templates or its explanations, this is the repo to issue your request and to fix it.
